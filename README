	This is a small project I worked on in my Data Structures and Algorithms course at the University of Scranton. Some of the code was provided by my professor, Dr. Jack Beidler, but the most of it was written by me. The program takes a map of the continental United States and a text file with coordinate information as input. The program then proceeds to color the map utilizing only four colors. The code implements a Greedy Algorithm and the coordinate information file has a deliberate inefficiency in it so that the algorithm can be fully demonstrated. 
	In order to run the program, the class path of your IDE will have to include a path to the cs2.jar file included in the repository.
